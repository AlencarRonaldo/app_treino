## 6. TECHNICAL RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### 6.1 Containment Procedures

#### Network Isolation
```bash
# Emergency network isolation script
#!/bin/bash

# Block suspicious IP immediately
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s $SUSPICIOUS_IP -j DROP
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d $SUSPICIOUS_IP -j DROP

# Isolate compromised server
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s $COMPROMISED_SERVER -j DROP
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d $COMPROMISED_SERVER -j DROP

# Log actions
echo "$(date): Isolated $SUSPICIOUS_IP and $COMPROMISED_SERVER" >> /var/log/incident_response.log
```

#### Database Security Response
```sql
-- Emergency database containment procedures

-- 1. Terminate suspicious connections
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE client_addr = '$SUSPICIOUS_IP';

-- 2. Revoke access from compromised accounts
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM suspicious_user;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public FROM suspicious_user;

-- 3. Change passwords for service accounts
-- (Execute via secure admin connection only)

-- 4. Enable additional logging
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 0;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- 5. Create audit trail
INSERT INTO incident_audit_log (incident_id, action, timestamp, details)
VALUES ('INC-2025-XXX', 'database_containment', NOW(), 'Emergency response actions executed');
```

#### Application-Level Response
```typescript
// Emergency application security measures

class IncidentResponse {
  // Enable maintenance mode
  static async enableMaintenanceMode(): Promise<void> {
    await redis.set('maintenance_mode', 'true');
    await redis.set('maintenance_message', 'System maintenance in progress. Please try again later.');
    console.log('Maintenance mode enabled');
  }

  // Force logout all users
  static async forceLogoutAll(): Promise<void> {
    await redis.flushall(); // Clear all sessions
    await supabase.rpc('revoke_all_refresh_tokens');
    console.log('All users logged out');
  }

  // Block specific IP addresses
  static async blockIP(ip: string): Promise<void> {
    await redis.sadd('blocked_ips', ip);
    console.log(`IP ${ip} blocked`);
  }

  // Disable specific features
  static async disableFeature(feature: string): Promise<void> {
    await redis.hset('feature_flags', feature, 'false');
    console.log(`Feature ${feature} disabled`);
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Evidence Collection

#### Log Collection Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Incident evidence collection script

INCIDENT_ID="INC-2025-XXX"
EVIDENCE_DIR="/var/incident_evidence/$INCIDENT_ID"

mkdir -p "$EVIDENCE_DIR"

# System logs
cp /var/log/auth.log* "$EVIDENCE_DIR/"
cp /var/log/syslog* "$EVIDENCE_DIR/"

# Application logs  
cp /var/log/treinosapp/* "$EVIDENCE_DIR/"

# Network connections
netstat -an > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/network_connections.txt"
ss -tuln > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/listening_ports.txt"

# Process list
ps auxf > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/process_list.txt"

# Memory dump (if needed)
if [ "$1" == "memory" ]; then
  dd if=/proc/kcore of="$EVIDENCE_DIR/memory_dump.img"
fi

# File system timeline
find /home /var/www /opt -type f -newermt "2025-08-07 00:00" -ls > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/file_timeline.txt"

# Create checksums for evidence integrity
cd "$EVIDENCE_DIR"
sha256sum * > evidence_checksums.txt

echo "Evidence collected in: $EVIDENCE_DIR"
```

### 6.3 Forensic Procedures

#### Database Forensics
```sql
-- Database forensic analysis queries

-- 1. Identify unauthorized access patterns
SELECT 
    datname, 
    usename, 
    client_addr, 
    COUNT(*) as connection_count,
    MIN(backend_start) as first_connection,
    MAX(backend_start) as last_connection
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE backend_start > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY datname, usename, client_addr
ORDER BY connection_count DESC;

-- 2. Review recent database changes
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    tablename, 
    n_tup_ins, 
    n_tup_upd, 
    n_tup_del,
    last_autoanalyze,
    last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE last_autoanalyze > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
   OR last_autovacuum > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- 3. Check for suspicious queries in statement log
SELECT 
    query, 
    calls, 
    total_time, 
    mean_time,
    rows
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query ILIKE '%DROP%' 
   OR query ILIKE '%DELETE%' 
   OR query ILIKE '%TRUNCATE%'
ORDER BY total_time DESC;
```
